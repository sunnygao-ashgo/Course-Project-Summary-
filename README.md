# Project background

CBRE has thousands of pictures of flexible spaces around the globe and wants to better match the demand and supply based on the understanding of clientsâ€™ preferences on style.

For the team, our tasks are to:

- Test the idea of identifying and matching style
- Try different models to get latent style representations
- Design test prototypes for the product

We then divided into two teams:

a) Product team: follow the Sprint Method, use quick tests to cut down the risks, design prototypes (Yajing, Brian)

b) Technical team: collect and clean sample data, test models (Xuelan, Maria, Yiyuan)
